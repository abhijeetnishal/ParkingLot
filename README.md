This is parking lot management application using object oriented programming and basic data structures.

First setup an IDE for running C++ program.
I used Sublime text as an IDE.

Setting up an IDE :

Step 1: Installing Sublime Text
Sublime Text is available for Mac, Linux and Windows. Follow the link below to install Sublime Text in your PC. 

https://www.sublimetext.com/

Now open Sublime Text.

Step 2: Setting up the layout
First, we’ll divide the current workspace into 3 parts one for our coding and the other two for the input and output respectively.

Go to- View > Layout > Columns: 3

Go to- View > Groups > Max Columns: 2

Step 3: Creating the necessary files
Now create a new folder anywhere you like and inside that create 3 files named:

main.cpp

input.txt

output.txt

You can name your “cpp” file anything you want but the other two files must be named “input.txt” and “output.txt”.

We can give input directly by typing in the input.txt file.

Step 4: Build and Run
Now we have to check whether our code is running perfectly and displaying the results in output.txt file or not.

Sublime already detects the file extension on which you are working and uses the right compiler for it.

Go to: Tools>Build with..

or use the shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + B

Click on C++ Single File — Run

Now your terminal should show that build finished successfully and the output will be displayed in the space of output.txt.
